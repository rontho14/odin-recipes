    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chilaquiles are basically corn tortilla pieces that are fried, cooked in salsa, 
        and sprinkled with cheese. They are often served for breakfast with eggs and a 
        side of beans or nopalitos.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>12 corn tortillas, preferably stale, or left out overnight to dry out a bit, 
            quartered or cut into 6 wedges</li>
        <li>Corn oil, or other neutral oil for frying</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 1/2 to 2 cups red chile sauce or salsa verde, store-bought or homemade</li>
        <li>Sprigs of epazote</li>
        <li>Cotija cheese or queso fresco</li>
        <li>Crema Mexicana or creme fraiche</li>
        <li>Cilantro, chopped</li>
        <li>1 red onion, chopped</li>
        <li>Avocado, sliced or roughly chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <p>In a large saut√© pan, coat pan generously with corn oil, (1/8 inch), 
                heat on medium high to high. When the oil is quite hot, add the tortillas, 
                fry until golden brown.</p>
            <p>Remove tortillas to a paper towel lined plate to soak up excess oil. 
                Sprinkle a little salt on the tortillas.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons of oil to pan, bring to high heat again. Add the salsa and let salsa 
            cook for several minutes. If you have a few sprigs of epazote, add them to the salsa.</li>
        <li>
            <p>Add the fried tortilla quarters to the salsa. Gently turn over the pieces of tortilla 
                until they are all well coated with salsa. Let cook for a few minutes more.</p>
            <p>Remove from heat. Serve chilaquiles with garnishes and fried eggs and beans or nopalitos.</p>
        </li>
