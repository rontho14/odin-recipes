    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
        Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! 
        This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h4>For the meat sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 medium onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>1/2 large bell pepper (green, red, or yellow), diced (about 3/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3 ounces tomato paste (half a 6-ounce can)</li>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano, or 2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley (preferably flat leaf), packed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch garlic powder and/or garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon red or white wine vinegar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers,
        onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes.
        The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor!</li>
        <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong>
            We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesanâ€”like the mix of tomatoes,
             this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, 
            a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. 
            Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
    </ol>
