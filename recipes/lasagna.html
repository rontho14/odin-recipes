    <h1>The best homemade Lasagna</h1>
    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
        Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! 
        This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Start by making the sauce</strong> with ground beef, bell peppers,
        onions, and a combo of tomato sauce, tomato paste, and crushed tomatoes.
        The three kinds of tomatoes gives the sauce great depth of flavor!</li>
        <li><strong>Let this simmer while you boil the noodles and get the cheeses ready.</strong>
            We're using ricotta, shredded mozzarella, and parmesanâ€”like the mix of tomatoes,
             this 3-cheese blend gives the lasagna great flavor!</li>
        <li><strong>From there, it's just an assembly job.</strong> A cup of meat sauce, 
            a layer of noodles, more sauce, followed by a layer of cheese. 
            Repeat until you have three layers and have used up all the ingredients.</li>
        <li><strong>Bake until bubbly and you're ready to eat!</strong></li>
    </ol>
